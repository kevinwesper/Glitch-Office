I tested the original position and angle of things.

The way the system is set up in the testing room, the south of the playing field is the most regular way of looking. If you sit 
behind the computer and look at the screen you look in the -Z direction. As you are probably starting from this position, it would 
be wise to program in this direction. This would differ of course when we actually need to test it for the final assignment, so we 
should be able to edit it to rotate really quickly, or we can ask Rieneke who will in turn ask in what direction we will be facing.

In the Basic VR scene is a basic setup for camera and controller tracking, so that would work, just copy and paste the thing if you need it.


Fixed it, it is now looking towards the north, following the Z axis in a logical order.
